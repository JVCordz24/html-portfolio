    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I am John Vergel Cordova. I am originally from the Philippines, but
      moved here in Spain for work and live with my family. I also graduated
      with a <strong>Bachelor in Information Technology</strong> from the
      University of the Visayas in the Philippines.
    </p>

      Before moving and working here in Spain I worked as a
      <strong>Radio Technician</strong> in Cebu for a local radio station. I
      only worked one year in the said radio station before deciding to move
      here in Spain. And here I rediscovered my curiosity about programming and
      started learning different programming languages from Java to Python and
      now I end up with web development.

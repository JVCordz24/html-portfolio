    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>High School Musical 1, 2 and 3</h3>
    <p>
      Great story and songs, still finding myself singing their songs years
      after watching it.
    </p>
    <h3>Transformers</h3>
    <p>
      If you want an action packed and full of robots movie. This is the go to
      movie I would recommend
    </p>
    <h3>Harry Potter Movies</h3>
    <p>
      A good movie adaptation of the book with the same name. Great if you want
      movies about magic and drama.
